# Playdate

Playdate is an application designed to simplify the process of arranging playdates for parents. As any parent knows, it can often take hours or even days to coordinate schedules and respond to text messages amidst the chaos of daily life. This app aims to alleviate the challenges associated with scheduling playdates, making it easier for parents to connect and organize opportunities for their children to socialize and play together.

## User Experience

### Project Goals

The goal for DADJOKES was to create an easy-to-navigate site that users can visit when they lie on the couch watching a bad movie or are on the train during a workday morning. It should be a site where users can get away for a little while.

### Agile Methodology

Agile Methodology was used to help prioritize and organize tasks for the hole webpage. I used Project Boards on Github.

* Epics were written containing possible user stories and based on that the website was made.
* User stories were created by looking at epics and added on as the project was advancing.
* Project Board was used to track progression of the task through the Todo, In progress and Done columns
